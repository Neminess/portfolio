                    <p>I have been learning web-coding for about 3 years now, the last two in school. The first year I learned about html and CSS, and how to use them together. 
                         In school, we were taught about JS, one course of PhP, Wordpress and more.</p>
                    <p>My favourite techs to use are JS, React JS and SQL. I am also interested in Wordpress for the simplicity and fast deployment it enables.</p>
